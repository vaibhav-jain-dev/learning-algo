# Spiral Matrix Transpose

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Read a matrix in spiral order and write the values in spiral order to a transposed-dimension matrix.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input (2x3):
  [[1, 2, 3],
   [4, 5, 6]]

Spiral read: [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]

Output (3x2) spiral write:
  [[1, 2],
   [5, 3],
   [4, 6]]
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- Matrix contains integers
