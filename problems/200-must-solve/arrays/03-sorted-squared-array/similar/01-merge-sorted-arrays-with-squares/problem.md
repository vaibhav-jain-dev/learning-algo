**Difficulty:** Medium (Yellow)

## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays, square all elements and merge them into a single sorted array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr1 = [-3, -1, 2], arr2 = [-2, 4]
Output: [1, 4, 4, 9, 16]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr1 = [-5, 0, 3], arr2 = [1, 2, 6]
Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 25, 36]
```

## Constraints
