# Python Dependencies
# ===================
# Add your Python package dependencies here.
# This file is used for Docker layer caching - dependencies are only
# re-installed when this file changes.
#
# Example:
#   numpy>=1.24.0
#   pandas>=2.0.0
#   requests>=2.28.0
#
# Note: The Python kernel for code execution uses only the standard library
# for security reasons. These dependencies are for application-level use only.
